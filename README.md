## blaTEM Phylogenetic Analysis Project

### Overview
This project investigates the evolutionary relationships of the blaTEM beta-lactamase gene across multiple multidrug-resistant bacteria. blaTEM is responsible for resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics and spreads through horizontal gene transfer.

### Research Question
-	How has blaTEM diversified across different bacterial pathogens?
-	What are the phylogenetic relationships between blaTEM variants from Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria?

### Methods Summary
-	Collected blaTEM sequences from public databases (NCBI)
-	Performed Multiple Sequence Alignment (MEGA X)
-	Built a Phylogenetic Tree using Neighbor-Joining method
-	Interpreted the tree to identify evolutionary patterns

### Findings
-	Some blaTEM variants from unrelated bacteria clustered together, suggesting horizontal gene transfer.
-	Klebsiella pneumoniae formed a separate branch, indicating divergence.

### Tools Used
-	MEGA X
-	UniProt databases
